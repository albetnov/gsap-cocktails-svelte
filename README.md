# Cocktails Svelte

This project is based on: [Web Animations Full Course 2025 | Build an Awwwards Website & Master GSAP in Two Hours](https://youtu.be/AW1yfBKRMKc?si=8yrW4Z222FZAD5dp). Gratitude to the author!

I have always wanted to learn GSAP and Web Animations in general. You know, they just looked cool. Then this course appear :v not sure if I can master them in 2 hours. But, hey deserve a shot right?

So this project is basically recreating the React ones in Svelte. Why Svelte? Nothing specific, I just want to try GSAP in framework agonistic way. Without the struggles of you know... rendering twice, managing dependencies, etc?

## Installation

You would only need `bun`. Go get them, then run:

```bash
bun i
bun dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` and voila.
